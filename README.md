FOR ANYONE REVIEWING THIS CODE: This C++ project starts from code given to us by Dr Rich Davison at Newcastle University. Naturally, I want to draw your attention to code I actually wrote rather than his (not that it isn't brilliant!).

I wrote everything in DiceRoller.h/cpp, with the exception of UpdateKeys().
I wrote D4.h, D6.h, D8.h, and D20.h
I also wrote all of the GJK and EPA functions.
